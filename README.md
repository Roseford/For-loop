# For-loop
The for-loop basically goes through a particular set of assigned strings until the break command is evoked as seen in the thrird set of code.
The first and second set of code shows what the for-loop is basically used for. The later uses the index method to call on the assigned strings and can limit how many strings are called.
The third code shows the implementation of the if-elif-else, f-string method and the for-loop. This set of code assigned outputs to the different strings when called. The third set of code is a sight for sore eyes. It is one pretty code.
